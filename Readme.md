Basics of Statistics

## Types of Statistics

# 1. Descriptive Statistics: 
Organsing and summarizing data. like what is average height of students in class
# 2. Infrential Statistics
technique thatwe have use to measure conclusions. Like can we say US boys are taller than Indian boy in class

# Sampling technique

Population N, Sample n

## Types of sampling
## 1. Simple Random sampling
 When performing SRS every member of population has chance get selected.
## 2. Stratified  sampling
 It's technique when popluation (N) is split into non-overlapping groups (strata)
 Based on Gender -> (Male, Female)
 Based on age ( 0-10, 10-20,20-40)
 Based on profession, doctors , engineers
 based on skills may bot be possible because skills can overlap
 ## 3. Systamatic Sampling
  From population select nth person.
  Covid survey in mall (8th person) entering mall.
  based on skills may bot be possible because skills can overlap
 ## 3. Convenience Sampling
 All persons who are intrested will be included in sampling.
 Like survey for data scientist should be done who has knowledge about data scietist.
 e,g stack overflow developer survey
 
# What is called variables
Variable is a property that can take any value like height, weight

## Two kinds of variables
1. Quantitative
  Numerical like age
  a) Discreate values
   Class,pincode
  b) Continuous values
   height, weight, River length, Blood pressure
3. Qualititative / Catgorical value
  Based on characteristic we can do math operations
  eg, gender, martial status
 

1. Measure of central tendency
2. Measure of dispersion
3. Gausian distribution
4. Z - Score
5. Standard Normal distribution

## Central tendency
It refers to measure used to determine the center of distribution of the data.
# Mean = Sum(all numbers) / N
# Median = 
# Mode
